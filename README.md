How It Works
This app uses few-shot prompting to guide the LLM toward generating posts that match your selected topic and tone.

Under the hood:

LangChain routes your prompt to Groq‚Äôs LLaMA model
few_shot.py filters examples based on your selection
post_builder.py builds a prompt dynamically
llm_engine.py handles the actual LLM call
